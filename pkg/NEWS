Please note that only the most significant changes are reported here.
A full ChangeLog is available in the log messages of the SVN repository
on R-Forge.


            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.6-0

* maxLik() can perform maximum likelihood estimations under linear equality
  and inequality constraints on the parameters now (see documentation of the
  new argument "constraints"). Please note that estimations under constraints
  are experimental and have not been thoroughly tested yet.

* a new method "stdEr" to extract standard errors of the estimates has been
  introduced

* added a "coef" method for objects of class "summary.maxLik" that extracts
  the matrix of the estimates, standard errors, t-values, and P-values

* some minor bugs have been fixed

* we did some general polishing of the returned object and under the hood


            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.5-12 AND BEFORE
