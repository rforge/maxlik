THIS IS THE CHANGELOG OF THE "maxLik" PACKAGE

Please note that only the most significant changes are reported here.
A full ChangeLog is available in the log messages of the SVN repository
on R-Forge.


            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.7-2

* corrected negative definiteness correction of Hessian in maxNR() which led
to infinite loops

* changed stopping condition in sumt(): instead of checking whether estimates
are stimilar, we check for penalty being low now


            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.7-0

* Holding parameters fixed in maxNR() (and hence, also in maxBHHH()) should
  now be done by the new (optional) argument "fixed", because it is convenient
  to use than the "old" argument "activePar" in many situations. However, the
  "old" argument "activePar" is kept for backward-compatibility.

* added (optional) argument "fixed" to functions maxBFGS(), maxNM(), and maxSANN(),
  which can be used for holding parameters fixed at their starting values

* added function constrOptim2(), which is a modified copy of constrOptim()
  from the "stats" package, but which includes a bug fix

* added optional argument "cand" to function maxSANN(), which can be used to
  specify a function for generating a new candidate point (passed to argument
  "gr" of optim())

* added argument "random.seed" to maxSANN() to ensure replicability

* several mainly smaller improvements in ML estimations with linear equality
  and inequality constraints (via sumt() and constrOptim2(), respectively)

* several internal changes that make the code easier to maintain


            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.6-0

* maxLik() can perform maximum likelihood estimations under linear equality
  and inequality constraints on the parameters now (see documentation of the
  new argument "constraints"). Please note that estimations under constraints
  are experimental and have not been thoroughly tested yet.

* a new method "stdEr" to extract standard errors of the estimates has been
  introduced

* added a "coef" method for objects of class "summary.maxLik" that extracts
  the matrix of the estimates, standard errors, t-values, and P-values

* some minor bugs have been fixed

* we did some general polishing of the returned object and under the hood


            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.5-12 AND BEFORE

* please take a look at the log messages of the SVN repository on R-Forge
