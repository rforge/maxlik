Reviewer #1: The authors have done a nice job revising the paper.

There are aspects of the package, and the paper, that I still think are suboptimal:
the examples are a little too complicated, and despite the authors' efforts I still
find the scattering of capabilities across packages to be a bit frustrating.

* maxLik: BHHH and maxNR algorithms; stdEr accessor; SUMT method; greater support
for analytical gradients and Hessians
* mle2: formula interface for simple problems; wraps other optimizers (optimize,
 nlminb, etc.), including box-constraint optimizers; likelihood profiling;
 predict() and simulate() methods [for models fitted with formula interface]

 (And then there are other optimization wrappers, such as optimx.)

 I do really like the package's approach of separating the 'optimization wrapper' from
the maximum likelihood capabilities.

 Minor stylistic comments:

p. 3 l. 38 "methods; however,"

l. 46 "approximate" variance-covariance matrix (?)

p. 4 l. 10 "as [with?] the other packages" (or "Like other R packages")

is l. 19 really necessary?

p. 7 l. 51 "select [among] five optimization ..."

p. 11 l. 26 "Those will not be discussed here; the interested ..."

 l. 43 "can be an index vector"

p. 15 l. 24 "The next novelty"
