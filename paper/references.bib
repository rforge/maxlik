  abstract = {We study a class of simulated annealing algorithms for global
  minimization of a continuous function defined on a subset of Rd. We consider
  the case where the selection Markov kernel is absolutely continuous and has a
  density which is uniformly bounded away from 0. This class includes certain
  simulated annealing algorithms recently introduced by various authors. We
  show that, under mild conditions, the sequence of states generated by these
  algorithms converges in probability to the global minimum of the function.
  Unlike most previous studies where the cooling schedule is deterministic, our
  cooling schedule is allowed to be adaptive. We also address the issue of
  almost sure convergence versus convergence in probability.}

  abstract = {This paper describes the implementation of Heckman-type sample
  selection models in R. We discuss the sample selection problem as well as the
  Heckman solution to it, and argue that although modern econometrics has non-
  and semiparametric estimation methods in its toolbox, Heckman models are an
  integral part of the modern applied analysis and econometrics syllabus. We
  describe the implementation of these models in the package sampleSelection
  and illustrate the usage of the package on several simulation and real data
  examples. Our examples demonstrate the effect of exclusion restrictions,
  identification at infinity and misspecification. We argue that the package
  can be used both in applied research and teaching.}
