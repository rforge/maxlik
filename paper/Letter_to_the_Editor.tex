Dear Editor,

thank you for the comments we received for our paper ``maxLik: A
Package for Maximum Likelihood Estimation in R''.  We feel that the
referees have done an excellent job.  Below is the list of changes we
have introduced to the paper.

\subsection*{Reviewer 1}

\begin{itemize}
\item We mention functions \texttt{mle} and \texttt{mle2}, and discuss
  the advantages/novelty of \texttt{maxLik}.
\item We briefly describe the idea of sequantial unconstrained
  maximization technique (SUMT).
\item We mention that the other ML-related packages do not provide
  \texttt{stdEr} or a direct analogue.
\item We streamlined the introduction of normal log-likelihood function.
\end{itemize}


We have also corrected a large number of typos.
