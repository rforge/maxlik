Description: Functions for Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation, non-linear
   optimization, and related tools.  It includes a unified way to call
   different optimizers, and classes and methods to handle the results from
   the Maximum Likelihood viewpoint.  It also includes a number of convenience
   tools for testing and developing your own models.
